# LuaHook-NG

## About

LuaHook-NG is intended to be a generic framework for offering a Lua functionality interface oriented towards games that utilise the language.

This code is currently **feature-incomplete** although the essential code is already there. Currently only one implementation of `LuaInterface` exists which is `PaydayLua` as the primary motivation of this project is to create a high-quality open-source Lua Hook since no fixes appear to be forthcoming to the original closed-source one.

A longer-term plan is to introduce **Google Test** into this project for reliable unit-testing.

## Dependencies

Currently all dependencies **except** Microsoft Detours are included in the Visual Studio solution.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome but familiarity with C++14 standards is a must.
