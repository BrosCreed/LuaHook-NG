# LuaHook-NG

## About

LuaHook-NG is intended to be a generic framework for offering a Lua functionality interface oriented towards games that utilise the language.

This code is currently stable although it only provides an implementation for PAYDAY 2 - the primary motivation of this project is to create a high-quality open-source Lua Hook that can be easily adapted to support any game.

A longer-term plan is to introduce **Google Test** into this project for reliable unit-testing.

## Dependencies

Currently all dependencies **except** Microsoft Detours are included in the Visual Studio solution. Work is planned to switch this dependency to PolyHook which is provided under an MIT license and would therefore be suitable for inclusion.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome but familiarity with C++14 standards is a must.
